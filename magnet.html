		<p>Due to the decentralized and serverless nature of ZeroNet, it can take quite a bit of disk space in order to store databases from every site, which in turn increases loading time for pages.</p>
<p>Unlike YouTube and The Pirate Bay, where you can search for torrents by simply connecting to their servers and retreiving SQL entries, on ZeroNet, the entire database of the site is downloaded to your computer.</p>
<p>Evidence of the disadvantages with this system can be witnessed by visiting <a href="http://127.0.0.1:43110/0list.bit/" target="_blank">0list.bit</a>. People who have already downloaded the site will be able to load it almost instantly, but for newcomers, it can take up to 2 minutes to completely load the site, due to the size of the database.</p>
<p>Now imagine if KopyKate were as big as YouTube. It would probably take a month to load the entire site and all of its magnet links!</p>
<p>For this reason, KopyKate will reset the entire database of the site every now and then, after reaching a certain limit, say, if the site were to take more than 1 minute to load. All of the site's magnet links will be saved into what we call a Magnet Book - a simple text file with torrent hash links. You would then load this file into our Magnet Book Browser (coming soon!) and you'll be able to search for the torrents contained within, just like the Yellow Pages.</p>
<p>Every magnet book will represent torrents that were posted within a certain period of time e.g. 6.09.2016-20.4.2017.txt . People will even be able to create custom books for private or unlisted videos.</p>
<p>Only quality torrents will be added to the official books, and manually so. In other words, if your torrent has no seeds, it won't be stored. If your torrent contains spam, advertising, random nonsense or even child pornography, it won't be stored, either.</p>
<p>Why reinvent the wheel, you ask? Why not just stick to centralized databases? Well, that's because centralized databases are usually the target for police raids. They are the Achilles heel of even the best of all torrent sites. If a database server is shut down, people can no longer search for torrents, and the whole purpose of the torrent site is defeated. Downloading magnet links isn't the issue - it's finding them.</p>
