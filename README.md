# kopy-kate v1.3 BETA

## Install instructions:

## KopyKate is a ZeroNet site, so it will only work on ZeroNet. It is an alternative to YouTube, but instead of hosting videos on webservers, it uses decentralized databases in order to store magnet links for videos, and then uses WebTorrent in order to stream them.

## 1. KopyKate is now clonable. Simply turn on ZeroNet, go to ZeroHello main page, and then select 'Clone' from the options next to the site on the list.

## 2. The cloned site is now 100% modifiable. Be sure to submit any pull requests to GitHub. Cheers!
