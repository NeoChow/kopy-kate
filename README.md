# kopy-kate v1.3.1 BETA

## Install instructions:

### KopyKate is a ZeroNet site, so it will only work on ZeroNet. It is an alternative to YouTube, but instead of hosting videos on webservers, it uses decentralized databases in order to store magnet links for videos, and then uses WebTorrent in order to stream them.

### 1. KopyKate is now clonable. Simply turn on ZeroNet, go to ZeroHello main page, and then select 'Clone' from the options next to the site on the list.
### 2. The cloned site is now 100% modifiable. Be sure to submit any pull requests to GitHub. Cheers!

## Credits to:

### - Ferros, creator of WebTorrent, Instant.io and WebTorrent.Desktop
### - Creators of ZeroTalk @ ZeroNet, which the core engine and site structure was based on.
### - Creators of ZeroNet for giving this project a platform to begin with.
### - Creator of ZeroTube for originally coming up with the idea.

## To-Do-List:

### - Create a means to stream videos on all browsers, perhaps by creating a universal external player?
### - Create a more user friendly uploader; a. perhaps by prompting user to download webtorrent desktop after adding a video b. also refusing to allow videos to be added unless number of Peers are more than 0.
### - Create an automatic webseed function. Video size must be less than e.g. 5mb. User can upload torrents and automatically get webseeded, but for a short period of time e.g. 24hrs.
