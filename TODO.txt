## TODO LIST:
## - Video player needs to be able to work on Chrome. There is a bug in Chrome which prevents videos from streaming if they are rendered in an iframe. ZeroNet uses iframes in order to render pages.
## - Need an admin interface to be able to delete video topics and comments.
## - Create an application that instantly downloads and seeds any magnet links that are added to your .db database. Anyone can then become a KopyKate seedbox, provided they have fast internet and lots of hard-disk space. This is to prevent videos from becoming seedless, due to lazy people forgetting to seed their videos after uploading magnet links!
